@article{Hsieh1996,
abstract = {{\v{Z}} . The receiver operating characteristic ROC curve describes the per-formance of a diagnostic test used to discriminate between healthy and diseased individuals based on a variable measured on a continuous scale. The data consist of a training set of m responses X , . . . , X from healthy 1 m individuals and n responses Y , . . . , Y from diseased individuals. The 1 n responses are assumed i.i.d. from unknown distributions F and G, re-spectively. We consider estimation of the ROC curve defined by {\v{Z}} y1 {\v{Z}} .. 1 y G F 1 y t for 0 F t F 1 or, equivalently, the ordinal dominance {\v{Z}} . {\v{Z}} y1 {\v{Z}} .. curve ODC given by F G t . First we consider nonparametric estima-tors based on empirical distribution functions and derive asymptotic properties. Next we consider the so-called semiparametric ''binormal'' model, in which it is assumed that the distributions F and G are normal after some unknown monotonic transformation of the measurement scale. For this model, we propose a generalized least squares procedure and compare it with the estimation algorithm of Dorfman and Alf, which is based on grouped data. Asymptotic results are obtained; small sample properties are examined via a simulation study. Finally, we describe a minimum distance estimator for the ROC curve, which does not require grouping the data.},

@book{Pepe2003,
abstract = {Techniques for evaluating medical diagnostic tests and biomarkers for detecting disease. More generally, the techniques pertain to the statistical classification problem for predicting a dichotomous outcome. Measures for quantifying test accuracy are described including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic likelihood ratios and the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve that is commonly used for continuous and ordinal valued tests. Statistical procedures are presented for estimating and comparing them. Regression frameworks for assessing factors that influence test accuracy and for comparing tests while adjusting for such factors are presented. This book presents many worked examples of real data and should be of interest to practicing statisticians or quantitative researchers involved in the development of tests for classification or prediction in medicine.},

abstract = {Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves are commonly used to present re-sults for binary decision problems in ma-chine learning. However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has proper-ties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that opti-mize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},
