abstract = {SUMMARY Non-linear regression (NLR) analysis in chemometric applications is the main subject of the paper. The following novel items of NLR procedure are reported. The modification of gradient method is considered. For inversion of the Fisher matrix the recurrence algorithm based on the matrix exponential is used. A new method of sequential Bayesian estimation allows processing of the data successively for every response. Each data set is fitted individually, but taking into account the information about common parameters estimated on previous data sets. A posterior Bayesian distribution is built after every set processing. A new method of confidence estimation is suggested. Unlike bootstrap, not initial data but parameter estimates are simulated. This method has the same accuracy as bootstrap but is about 1000 times faster. A new coefficient of non-linearity is introduced. It is calculated by the Monte Carlo procedure and accounts for the model structure as well as the experimental design features. All new ideas were implemented in the software FITTER, a new Excel Add-In. Its main capabilities are reported. The paper is illustrated with a number of practical examples in DSC, TMA and TGA data analysis.},

abstract = {A parametric bootstrap estimate (PB) may be more accurate than its non-parametric version (NB) if the parametric model upon which it is based is, at least approximately, correct. Construction of an optimal estimator based on both PB and NB is pursued with the aim of minimizing the mean squared error. Our approach is to pick an empirical estimate of the optimal tuning parameter ee[0,1] which minimizes the mean square error of eNB + (1 — e) PB. The resulting hybrid estimator is shown to be more reliable than either PB or NB uniformly over a rich class of distributions. Theoretical asymptotic results show that the asymptotic error of this hybrid estimator is quite close in distribution to the smaller of the errors of PB and NB. All these errors typically have the same convergence rate of order O(n{\~{}}{\~{}}{\%}). A particular example is also presented to illustrate the fact that this hybrid estimate can indeed be strictly better than either of the pure bootstrap estimates in terms of minimizing mean squared error. Two simulation studies were conducted to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the good practical performance of the hybrid method. 1. Introduction The idea of bootstrapping in statistical estimation was put forward by Efron[2]. The bootstrap method can be applied in both parametric and non-parametric fashions. In the context of estimation of a statistical functional a(F) based on a random sample of size n from an unknown distribution F, the parametric bootstrap estimate (PB) and the non-parametric bootstrap estimate (NB) amount to replacing F by F and F n respectively, where 8 n is some estimate of the index 8 parametrizing a family {\{}F 6 {\}} thought to contain F, and F n is the usual empirical distribution with equal probability placed on each data point. In the literature PB and NB have been discussed mainly as two quite separate procedures. Their relative performance depends largely on correctness of our assumption of the parametric model. The estimate PB is generally more accurate if our proposed model is sufficiently close to F, whereas NB is the better choice if the parametric model is far from correct. The question of which one to use in circumstances where knowledge of the underlying distribution is vague remains unanswered. A straightforward criterion to guide our choice between the two bootstrap estimates is necessary. Hjort[5] looks briefly at an intermediate bootstrap estimate (IB) obtained by replacing F with a mixture distribution eF{\$} +(l — e)F n , where ee[0,},

@article{Marra2011,
abstract = {We study the coverage properties of Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs) represented using any penalized regression spline approach. The intervals are the usual generalization of the intervals first proposed by Wahba and Silverman in 1983 and 1985, respectively, to the GAM component context. We present simulation evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal 'across-the-function' frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. Otherwise, because the Bayesian intervals account for bias and variance, the coverage probabilities are surprisingly insensitive to the exact choice of smoothing parameter. The theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identifiability constraints. Instead intervals should be produced for each function as if only the other model terms were subject to identifiability constraints. If this is done then coverage probabilities are improved.},
