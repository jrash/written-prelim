# Overview of contents

`supplementary/final_report` contains the rmarkdown file and the files used to generate the document.  

The supplementary contains a file called "simulations_long.rmd" with all of the code I used to simulate my data.  "simulations_long.pdf" is the compiled pdf, which contains figures illustrating the optimal clusterings of each of the simulated data sets.
